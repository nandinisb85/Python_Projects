**Job Recommendation System **- 
This project implements a job recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The system takes a job title as input and recommends the top 5 similar job titles based on various features such as job experience required, key skills, functional area, industry, and job title.

Introduction - 
The job recommendation system is designed to help users find similar job titles based on their input. It combines multiple features from the job dataset, performs TF-IDF vectorization, and computes cosine similarity to identify and recommend similar job titles.

Features -
1.Combine multiple columns into a single feature for vectorization.
2.Apply TF-IDF vectorization to the combined features.
3.Compute cosine similarity between job titles.
4.Recommend the top 5 job titles similar to the input job title.
5.Visualize the similarity scores of the recommended job titles.

Requirements - 
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Data - 
The dataset should be a CSV file named jobs.csv with the following columns:
Job Salary
Job Experience Required
Key Skills
Role Category
Functional Area
Industry
Job Title

Summary - 
A job recommender system is designed to suggest suitable job opportunities to users based on their skills and preferred job roles. Popular platforms like LinkedIn utilize such systems to assist users in finding jobs that best match their profiles. This summary explores the creation of a job recommender system using Python, employing techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze and recommend jobs based on various features like job experience, key skills, functional area, industry, and job title. The article also demonstrates how to visualize the recommendations and key features using bar plots and word clouds.
